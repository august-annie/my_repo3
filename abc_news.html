       <h2 class="font">Solution</h2>
       <p class="body">To make it easier to find news on the ABC News website, we will add a second menu with more options when you click on it. Also, we will make the website look nicer and work better on all devices, like phones and computers. This will help people find what they need faster and enjoy reading the news more.</p>

        <h2 class="font">Approach</h2>
        <p class="body">As a first step, we checked how people use ABC News website and what parts they struggle with. We also looked at website data to see which pages are popular and how users move around. This helped us plan how to make the website easier to use. We used what we learned to create a new menu and design system that fits better with what users need. Our goal is to make ABC News website more user-friendly based on feedback and data.</p>

       <h2 class="font">Interview Findings</h2>
       <p class="body">5 people were interviewed and observed browsing the existing ABC News website and 80% of completion rate for the usability testing.</p>
       <p class="body bullet-point">Users want an easy way to choose specific activities from the main menu.</p>
       <p class="body bullet-point">The [Listen] page needs better organisation and less cluttered icons for better user experience.</p>

        <h2 class="font">Website Analysis</h2>
        <p class="body">After analysing the website and conducting user testing, a notable issue became apparent: the primary navigation on ABC News webpages lacked clarity. Users found it confusing because there was no secondary drop-down menu to give more details about each topic. This meant users had to rely solely on the main navigation to understand the topics, making it harder to find what they were looking for.</p>

       <h2 class="font">Architecture</h2>
        <p class="body">To develop the physical product, I initially identified business aims and essential user requirements, which served as the foundation for crafting a primary architectural strategy. This strategy was devised through the formulation of "How Might We" statements, enabling us to address user needs effectively while also considering the feasibility of technological implementations and task mappings.</p>
        <h3 class="font">How might we?</h3>
        <p class="body bullet-point">How might we deliver concise and easily digestible news summaries to Eveline, allowing her to stay informed despite her busy schedule?</p>

        <div class="space"></div> 
        <h3 class="font">Site Map</h3>
           <p class="body">To enhance the navigation system on the ABC News homepage, I utilised the open card sorting method to organize the information architecture. This method enabled brainstorming and logical grouping, leading to a user-friendly site map. By prioritising clarity and ease of navigation, we improved the user experience, allowing visitors to effortlessly discover and engage with content on the ABC News website.</p>

             <h2 class="font">Design Decision</h2>
              <p class="body">In our updated design for the ABC News website, our main goal is to ensure ease of readability and navigation for all users. We opt for clear fonts and ample spacing between elements to facilitate comfortable reading, benefiting users of all abilities, including those with visual impairments.</p>
              <p class="body">Similarly, when curating our Autumn Vintage mood-board, our primary focus is on enhancing user-friendliness by selecting colours that capture the cozy allure of the fall season. We incorporate deep reds and oranges to evoke warmth, while mustard yellow, olive green, and warm browns add depth and visual appeal. Additionally, softer tones like mauve, pink, and green contribute to a vintage aesthetic, inviting users to indulge in the nostalgic ambiance of autumn.</p>

                  <p class="body">Using a responsive grid design improves accessibility and ensures easy adaptation across different devices. By employing fluid grids and flexible layouts, content can adjust dynamically to various screen sizes and resolutions. This approach enhances user experience, enabling individuals to access and interact with the website or application comfortably, regardless of the device they're using. Additionally, integrating responsive design principles promotes inclusivity by catering to users with diverse accessibility needs, such as those who rely on screen readers or have limited dexterity. Overall, a responsive grid design fosters usability and guarantees a consistent and intuitive experience across all devices.</p>

                                        <p class="body">After several rounds of user testing, it became evident that users were experiencing confusion with the share button, particularly with the transition from an add icon to an arrow icon. This led to misunderstandings, as users initially perceived the button as expanding the article. After careful consideration, I ultimately decided to replace the icon with a "share" button, which resulted in a marked improvement in usability during testing.</p>

Our user-entered approach has allowed us to identify critical errors, assess navigation challenges, and recognise successful task flows. We have ensured that relevant information is presented effectively, contributing to a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for our audience.</p>

                                          <p class="body">Building upon the findings from usability testing, our next step is to implement iterative design changes to address identified issues and enhance user satisfaction further. This includes refining navigation elements, optimising content layout, and integrating user-friendly features. Additionally, we will continue to monitor user feedback and conduct usability tests regularly to ensure ongoing improvement and alignment with user needs and preferences. Our ultimate goal is to create a seamless and engaging digital platform that provides users with easy access to reliable news content.</p>
