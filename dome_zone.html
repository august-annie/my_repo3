        <p class="body">A significant challenge for the Dome Zone Mental Health App is ensuring widespread acceptance and effective utilisation among Australians. Despite its user-friendly design, obstacles like stigma and limited awareness may persist. To address this, we must extensively promote the app and tailor it to meet the diverse needs of users.

        <h2 class="font">Approach</h2>
        <p class="body">Our approach to addressing the challenge of integrating standardised abuse report forms across all states for the RSPCA website redesign project involves three key steps. First, we conduct usability testing to assess the ease of use and effectiveness of the redesigned forms. Second, we use affinity diagrams to organize and prioritise feedback gathered from usability testing sessions. Lastly, we perform website analysis to identify areas for improvement based on user behaviour metrics. Through this iterative process, we aim to refine the forms to meet both regulatory requirements and user needs, empowering users to report abuse effectively across all states.</p>

Firstly, we utilised the header space by introducing a circular progress bar icon, allowing users to track their current stage in the app's journey. Additionally, we implemented a 5-star rating system below each psychologist's name and education, ensuring that the star colours provide excellent accessibility contrast for all users. Furthermore, we adjusted the design's structure and layout to optimise screen space usage, enhancing overall usability and visual appeal.</p>

                      <p class="body">In addition to addressing user feedback, we streamlined the user journey by consolidating unnecessary screens into a single, more efficient screen, eliminating redundancy and simplifying navigation. The calendar function was strategically relocated to the final booking stage, empowering users to seamlessly add appointment times to their local calendars. To enhance readability and visual coherence, we made adjustments to font size, text colour, and background colour throughout the app, ensuring a more cohesive and user-friendly UI design. Notably, we increased the font size on the home screen to prominently highlight that users can enjoy their first session with Dome Zone for free when booking their initial appointment, effectively communicating this valuable benefit to users.</p>

                                      <p class="body">The chosen shade of green for the Dome Zone Mental Health app was purposefully selected due to its profound psychological benefits. Green is known to evoke feelings of tranquility, balance, and harmony, making it a calming hue that can alleviate stress and anxiety. Drawing from alternative healing practices such as chromotherapy, green light is believed to have a calming and balancing effect on the mind and body. Furthermore, the Biophilia Hypothesis suggests that humans have an inherent connection with nature, and exposure to natural elements like greenery can positively impact well-being, potentially leading to improved mental health and reduced anxiety.</p>
