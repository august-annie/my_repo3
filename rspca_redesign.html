          <p class="body">The primary focus of the RSPCA website redesign project is to address the inconsistency and complexity of animal cruelty report forms across different states in Australia. Currently, this variation leads to confusion and frustration among users, hindering their ability to report abuse effectively. Our goal is to create a unified reporting platform that streamlines the process and empowers users to advocate for animal rights with ease.</p>
          <p class="body">Central to this effort is redesigning the animal cruelty report forms to ensure consistency and clarity across all states. By unifying the design, we aim to simplify the reporting process and eliminate barriers that may deter users from speaking up against abuse. Emphasizing user-centric design principles, we are committed to enhancing the usability of the platform and facilitating smoother reporting experiences for all users.</p>

        <p class="body">A key challenge in the RSPCA website redesign is ensuring that standardised abuse report forms are smoothly integrated across all states. This involves maintaining consistency while accommodating different legal frameworks and regional reporting requirements. Balancing user-friendly design, legal compliance, and local variations will require careful planning, collaboration with stakeholders, and thorough testing to ensure that the platform empowers users to report abuse effectively without confusion or barriers.</p>

       <p class="body">To overcome this obstacle, we will design user-friendly abuse report forms that comply with regulations across all states. Our approach involves crafting a unified form that considers diverse legal frameworks and regional variations. Through collaboration with stakeholders and rigorous testing, we'll ensure the platform enables users to report abuse effectively, promoting clarity and accessibility while maintaining professionalism.</p>

        <h2 class="font">Approach</h2>
        <p class="body">Our approach to addressing the challenge of integrating standardised abuse report forms across all states for the RSPCA website redesign project involves three key steps. First, we conduct usability testing to assess the ease of use and effectiveness of the redesigned forms. Second, we use affinity diagrams to organize and prioritise feedback gathered from usability testing sessions. Lastly, we perform website analysis to identify areas for improvement based on user behaviour metrics. Through this iterative process, we aim to refine the forms to meet both regulatory requirements and user needs, empowering users to report abuse effectively across all states.</p>

       <h2 class="font">Interview Findings</h2>
       <p class="body">6 people were interviewed and observed browsing the existing RSPCA Report Cruelty website and 70% of completion rate for the usability testing.</p>
       <p class="body bullet-point">Users express the need for follow-up after submitting a report.</p>
       <p class="body bullet-point">Many users feel stressed upon encountering the current forms.</p>

      <h2 class="font">Website Analysis</h2>
      <p class="body">After analysing the website and conducting user testing, a notable issue became apparent: the primary navigation on ABC News webpages lacked clarity. Users found it confusing because there was no secondary drop-down menu to give more details about each topic. This meant users had to rely solely on the main navigation to understand the topics, making it harder to find what they were looking for.</p>

        <p class="body">Based on our analysis using SimilarWeb's data on the most viewed animal websites, we evaluated two key competitors: Animal Welfare and Animal Australia. Animal Welfare demonstrates a strong information layout, providing valuable content for users. However, there is room for improvement in terms of user interface design. On the other hand, Animal Australia stands out with its impressive UI design, offering a visually appealing browsing experience. However, there is a notable weakness in their web design's responsiveness. By combining the strengths of Animal Welfare's content layout and Animal Australia's UI design, we have an opportunity to create a superior user experience that caters to both informative content and visual appeal, ultimately setting us apart in the market.</p>

             <p class="body">After creating an initial sketch and design for the RSPCA form, aligned with the task and user flow, we observed that completing the process on a single page might be overwhelming for users. To improve the user experience, we opted to ease the task load for each step by dividing the process into multiple manageable steps, as illustrated in the User Flow Iterations below. This approach aims to enhance user satisfaction and engagement throughout the reporting process. We sketched various ideas and tried out different formats based on the task and user flow to ensure optimal usability and effectiveness.</p>

                      <p class="body">In our redesign of the RSPCA report cruelty form, we deeply incorporated design thinking principles and made continuous improvements based on feedback from users. We carefully examined what changes would have the greatest impact for both users and stakeholders. Considering the input from a specific group of users and their challenges, we emphasised creating a clear and easy-to-use form interface. We introduced drop-down menus for addresses and included a calendar feature to improve the user experience. Furthermore, we added a drop-down message box that can be accessed from the entry button. Our main focus was on ensuring a logical flow within the form, so users can understand the entire process from beginning to end. To show the duration and progress of the reporting process, we found that time stamps and a progress bar were the most effective tools. These adjustments collectively aim to make the reporting experience with the RSPCA smoother and more user-friendly.</p>

                          <p class="body">We have included two completed pages for the form. If a user chooses to report anonymously, it will not show that a copy of the report is sent via email. However, if the user provides personal details and requests a follow-up, a copy of the report will be sent to them, followed by a subsequent call or email. This design adjustment was made based on feedback from user interviews, where users expressed the desire for both follow-up on the reporting case and the option to report anonymously for privacy reasons.</p>
