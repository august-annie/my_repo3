                      <p class="body">Input fields utilise a deep blue background with white text. Submit buttons feature a white background with blue text. Input fields have clear focus states as the line will change from 1px to 2px to indicate user interaction, and form labels are placed above the fields for improved usability, especially on smaller screens.</p>
                      <h3 class="font">Cards</h3>
                      <p class="body">Elite Property Law's website incorporates a cards section to spotlight essential information and services. These cards come in two sizes: small and medium. Small cards, set against a light grey background with black font, include a Heading 4, Heading 1, and Paragraph to clearly express important information. Medium cards follow the same colour scheme and contain a centrally aligned Heading 1, Paragraph, and button. This design strategy ensures uniformity and readability across all card sizes, facilitating user comprehension and interaction with the content provided.</p>
