          <p class="body">For the BiTQ Website Revamp project, I transformed an outdated and user-unfriendly site into a powerful client attraction tool. The challenge was clear: poor navigation and an uninspiring design held BiTQ back. With user feedback and analytics, I identified key pain points and, in collaboration with BiTQ stakeholders, set clear goals. We aimed for a modern design that communicated BiTQ's expertise in data engineering and AI compellingly. I crafted wireframes and mock-ups, ensuring intuitive navigation and sleek design.</p>
          <p class="body">The content strategy was crucial. By developing engaging copy and multimedia, we highlighted BiTQ's success stories and industry expertise. Rigorous testing ensured functionality across devices and browsers, and user feedback guided iterative improvements. The revamped website now effectively showcases BiTQ's capabilities, attracting new clients and demonstrating their competitive edge. This project revitalised BiTQ's digital presence, making it a testament to their expertise and a magnet for growth.</p>

            <h3 class="font">Existing Problems</h3>
            <p class="body">During my evaluation of the current BiTQ website, I identified several key issues that need addressing. Firstly, users find it difficult to navigate due to unclear menus and links. Secondly, the website's design is outdated and does not reflect BiTQ's expertise in data engineering and AI, impacting user experience negatively. Additionally, the site fails to engage users effectively, resulting in a high bounce rate. Lastly, there is a lack of clear information hierarchy, making it hard for users to find the information they need. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the user experience and better represent BiTQ's strengths.</p>

            <p class="body">Users' Attention Gets Distracted Due to External Links:</p>

            <p class="body bullet-point">This distracts users and diminishes the focus on BiTQ's core content and offerings.</p>

                 <h3 class="font">Revamping Navigation and Site Map</h3>
                 <p class="body">In the project to improve BiTQ's website, I focused on making the navigation and site map more user-friendly. I restructured the main navigation into five clear sections: Home, About, Services, Insight, and Team. This made it easier for users to find information quickly. Each section was organised logically to help users move through the site smoothly and find what they need without confusion.</p>
                 <h3 class="font">Categorising Information</h3>
                 <p class="body">I categorised information into specific sections to keep everything clear and relevant. The 'Home' section was redesigned to show an overview of BiTQ's best work, focusing on case studies that highlight their expertise. The 'About' section explains BiTQ's mission, vision, and values, helping users understand who BiTQ is. The 'Services' section details the various services BiTQ offers, making it easy for potential clients to see what BiTQ can do for them. The 'Insight' section features industry insights and thought leadership to engage users with valuable content. The 'Team' section introduces the people behind BiTQ, showcasing their skills and building trust with users.</p>
                 <h3 class="font">Implementing Accessibility Design Elements</h3>
                 <p class="body">To make the website accessible to everyone, I added several design elements. I chose colours and font sizes that are easy to read, even for users with visual impairments. Navigation menus were designed with clear labels and good contrast to make them easy to use. I also added visual cues throughout the site to guide users, improving the overall user experience.</p>
                 <h3 class="font">Optimising the Homepage</h3>
                 <p class="body">I designed the homepage to focus on BiTQ's case studies, giving potential clients a clear idea of BiTQ's strengths. By highlighting these case studies, users can quickly understand what BiTQ does best. The content on the homepage was arranged logically, starting with the most important information at the top. This structured layout helps users follow a clear path and understand BiTQ's value easily. In summary, I improved BiTQ's website by creating a clear and easy-to-use information architecture, logically categorising information, adding accessibility features, and optimising the homepage to showcase BiTQ's expertise. This approach ensures users can navigate the site easily, find relevant information, and understand BiTQ's full range of services.</p>

                     <p class="body">One of the most challenging aspects of the project was designing the site map and arranging content hierarchically and logically. It was crucial to consider the perspectives of users, the business, and stakeholders to create a design that meets everyone's needs. I focused on extracting the most valuable core of BiTQ and ensuring that the message was clearly delivered to users and buyers.</p>
                     <p class="body">To achieve this, I made sure that information was not overwhelming and that content was well-organised in a user-friendly design. I prioritised showcasing who BiTQ is and what they do best, heavily featuring their case studies. This approach aimed to provide solid assurance to users and buyers about BiTQ's successful projects, helping to build a reputation and trust in the industry through the revamped website.</p>
                     <p class="body">By balancing clarity, organisation, and engagement, I ensured that the revamped website effectively communicated BiTQ's expertise and strengths, ultimately supporting their business goals and enhancing user experience.</p>

                     <p class="body">During the initial phase of revamping BiTQ's website, I encountered challenges in designing the site map and organising content logically. This required balancing perspectives from users, the business, and stakeholders to achieve a cohesive design. Using low-fidelity (Lo-fi) designs, I mapped out the site's structure and navigation, focusing on simplicity and clarity. The goal was to highlight BiTQ's core strengths and achievements through case studies, aiming to build trust with potential clients. I also improved the design and colour scheme of the 'Team' section to emphasise BiTQ's expertise and professionalism.</p>
                     <h3 class="font">User Testing & Feedback</h3>
                     <p class="body bullet-point">Some users mentioned they would benefit from more detailed explanations or tooltips in certain sections to understand BiTQ's services better.</p>
                     <p class="body bullet-point">Users suggested enhancing the 'Team' section with more detailed profiles or direct links to individual team members for easier access.</p>
                     <p class="body bullet-point">There was feedback about ensuring important information is more prominently displayed to prevent it from feeling buried within menus or subpages.</p>
                     <p class="body bullet-point">Suggestions were made to adjust the colour contrast on text elements to improve readability, particularly for users with visual impairments.</p>
                     <p class="body bullet-point">Through our user interviews, it was evident that highlighting BiTQ's expertise in Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence at the forefront of the website would significantly increase user engagement and interest.</p>

                         <p class="body">During the design iteration of the Insight page, I initially placed the "What We Offer" section at the hero section of the website. However, through user testing and feedback analysis, it became evident that the core of BiTQ's business lies in Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. These areas are not only central to BiTQ's services but are also current hot topics in the industry.</p>
                         <p class="body">Leveraging design thinking principles, I decided to reposition the focus to highlight these key areas prominently. This decision was based on the understanding that showcasing BiTQ's expertise in these trending fields would not only attract more user attention but also improve the conversion rate. By aligning the design with user expectations and industry trends, we can effectively communicate BiTQ's value proposition and professional tech services, thereby enhancing user engagement and driving business growth. This iterative approach ensured that the final design was both user-centric and aligned with BiTQ's strategic goals.</p>

                    <p class="body">As a UX/UI designer, I meticulously selected the primary and secondary colour palettes for BiTQ to maintain the original essence of their black and gold branding while incorporating complementary cool tones for a more harmonious and accessible design. The primary colours chosen were #8B6E00 (gold), #D3D6DD (pale grey), and #1E1E1E (black). To balance these bold colours, I introduced secondary colours: #F4F7FC (pale grey), #A2A6AF (mid grey), #242E2D (dark grey), #3E5572 (navy blue), and #002047 (deep blue).</p><h3 class="font">Design Thinking and Visual Balance</h3>
                    <p class="body">High-quality and professional images related to Elite Property Law are incorporated, complementing the deep blue and grey colour palette. Images are optimised for fast loading times without compromising quality, ensuring a smooth user experience.</p><h3 class="font">Accessibility Considerations</h3>
                    <p class="body">Accessibility was a paramount consideration in my design process. I ensured that all colour choices provided high contrast, passing accessibility tests to enhance readability for all users, including those with visual impairments. This decision supports inclusive design practices, ensuring that BiTQ's website is usable by a diverse audience.</p><h3 class="font">Enhancing Brand Identity</h3>
                    <p class="body">Additionally, the colour palette was selected to create a cohesive visual identity that communicates professionalism and trustworthiness, which are key attributes for BiTQ's brand. By balancing the strong, original colours with softer, cooler tones, I aimed to evoke a sense of reliability and expertise, helping to build user confidence in BiTQ’s offerings. This strategic use of colour supports the overall user experience by making the website both aesthetically pleasing and functional.</p>

                      <p class="body">This project highlighted the importance of aligning website design with core business strengths and current industry trends. By focusing on user-centred design principles, we successfully transformed BiTQ's website into a platform that showcases their expertise in Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence while enhancing user engagement and client acquisition. The iterative design process, coupled with ongoing user feedback, showed that a clear emphasis on usability and aesthetics significantly improves the overall user experience.</p>
                      <p class="body">Incorporating animations and 3D elements could have made the website even more impactful and helped BiTQ stand out among competitors. Due to time and budget limitations, we were unable to include these features. However, enhancing the design with such elements in the future would further increase the site's appeal. This project reinforced the value of thorough research, strategic content placement, and responsive design in creating a successful digital presence. It also emphasised the necessity of adaptability and continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of UX/UI design.</p>
